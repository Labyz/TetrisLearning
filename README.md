# TetrisLearning
A custom Tetris game and the implementation of an AI solving it.

## Python modules required
- `numpy`
- `pygame`
- `sys`
- `keras`

## Description
- The file `tetrisgame.py` implements the Tetris game.
- The file `random_agent.py` implements an agent which plays the game by pressing random keys.
- The file `cnn_agent.py` implements a convolutional neural network which plays the game and learns from its actions.

## How to run
You can test the program yourself by running `python run_cnn_agent.py` in a terminal at the root of this repository.  
You can modify the parameters of the agent by editing the same file.
